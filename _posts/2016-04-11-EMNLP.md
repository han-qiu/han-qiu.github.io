### We have leaned
- Sequence models, HMM, structured perceptron
- Lexical processing: word segmentation分析, POS tagging词性标注, named entity recognition命名体识别, etc.

generative model 生成模型
global linear model 全局线性模型

y_hat = argmax_{y}(Score(x,y,w))

### We are going to learn
- Syntactic parsing[4 lectures]
  - Trees and grammars
  - Parsing Algorithms
  - Statistical models
  - History-based methods
- Semantic processing [2 lectures]
- Statistical machine translation[1 lecture]

### Let's start from TBBT(the Big Bang Theory)
I oil-wrestle an orangutan in a bikini.

*Preposition phrase attachment *

Other example: I saw John with a telescope

Syntactic structured

### What's syntax
Noam Chomsky
> Syntax is the study of the principles and processes by which sentences are constructed in particular languages

Two views of syntactic structures

- Constituency[phrase structure]
- Dependency 依存 分析

###Contituency(phrase structure)

The basic idea: Phrase structure organizes words into nested constituency, which can be represented as a tree.

每一个节点都是一个独立的使用单元。

有些歧义句法分析也无能为力：反对的是他

How do we know what is a constituency?

### Constituency test

Criteria

- Topicalization

话题化：

- Clefting/Pseudoclefting

Emphasis on a certain phrase

- Replacement

整体可以被替换

- Question test

短语通常可以用来回答一个问题。

- Coordination: 并列（right node rising)

### Challenge
Cross-serial dependencies

### Dependency syntax
The basic idea:

Syntactic structure consists of lexical 上位词，下位词

Problem：How do we know?

Criteria for heads and dependents

Criteria
1. H determines the syntactic category

### Some tricky cases

### Dependency graphs
connected.acyclic,single-head

### Comparison

### The parsing problem

### Applications of parsing
- Machine translation
- Information extraction
- Grammar checking

### An example: Machine translation
Goal: Translate "中国的经济发展" into English

- Parse
- Find pattern 可能有局部调序

### Compiler
AST:Abstract Syntax tree

Noam Chomsky'm major achievement :
to suggest that the syntax of natural languages

### Statistical disambiguation
James Clerk Maxwell

### Outline

Context-free Grammar

Formal Grammar

recursive enumerable >> context-sentitive >> context-free >> regular expression

### Where can I get a grammar?

English Treebank

Penn WSJ Treebank

Chinese Treebank

Chinese Treebank

### Dependency grammar as lexicalized CFG
each elemnts of the grammar contains at least one lexical item(teminal)

G1: S->SS,S->a
G2: S->aS,S->a

only projective-dependency tree 对于汉语，基本都可以用可投射的结构，英语中大部分都可以

### Tree-adoining Grammar
copy language is not CFL

Mildly context sensitive languages:

Natural Language is

### Tree decomposition
have entire construction as elementary building blocks

把大的句法树拆成小的，再将小的拼接起来

不断将叶子节点用相应的子树进行替换。

TSG Tree Substitute Grammar

CFG and TSG are weakly equivalent

CFG => TSG simple

TSG=>CFG

But TSG capture more generative than CFGs
- Lexicalization, subcategorization, dependencies

## Problem

多项式时间算法

可以有插入子树

### Tree decomposition

Extending the idea
A Tree Adjoining Grammar(TAG), is a vet of elementary tree

A finite set of initial Trees

a finite set of auxiliary Trees

Combinationarial operation

Substitution:
Adjunction:

G is called lexicalized grammar
