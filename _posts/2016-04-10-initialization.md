### Static storage and Automatic storage

Reference:

(cplus document)[http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/#storageclasses]

But there is another substantial difference between variables with static storage and variables with automatic storage:
- Variables with static storage (such as global variables) that are not explicitly initialized are automatically initialized to zeroes.
- Variables with automatic storage (such as local variables) that are not explicitly initialized are left uninitialized, and thus have an undetermined value.
